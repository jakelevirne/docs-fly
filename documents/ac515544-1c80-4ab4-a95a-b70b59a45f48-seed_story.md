## How we work

Thesis-driven and experimental
- [x] AI is changing the face of software development
- [x] Some personas are adopting radically new workflows
- [x] Context matters
- [ ] We can provide value to individuals
- [ ] Multi-tool is important; we're neutral
- [ ] The IDE is not the end-state tool for modern software development
- [ ] We can grow a sustainable community
- [ ] This will cause them to bring us to their teams
- [ ] Teams will pay us to help them manage context in this new workflow
- [ ] Context will replace code as the core artifact

## High conviction bets (how we'll accelerate)

- [ ] Integrations - SpecStory is everywhere you work
  - [ ] IDEs - Cursor, VSC
  - [ ] Agents - Claude Code
  - [ ] PM tools - Figma, GDocs, Miro
  - [ ] Collab tools - Slack, JIRA
- [ ] Intent graph
  - [ ] Dependent docs
  - [ ] Decision
- [ ] Bottoms-up distribution meets top-down purchasing
  - [ ] Educational content x1000
  - [ ] Continue founder-led sales, add outreach (BDR)
